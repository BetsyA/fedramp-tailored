#Innovation Definition: Mindsets Section Overview

Mindsets are established sets of attitudes held by someone. Carol Dweck, a Stanford psychologist and author of the book [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345472322/braipick-20) ([public library](http://www.worldcat.org/title/mindset-the-new-psychology-of-success/oclc/58546262&referer=brief_results)) studied the power of our beliefs, both conscious and unconscious, and how changing even the simplest of them can have profound impact on nearly every aspect of our lives.

She found in her research two types of mindsets--a "fixed" or “growth” mindset. A “fixed mindset” assumes our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static which we can’t change in any meaningful way and success affirms this belief and thus rejects failure. A “growth mindset,” on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. Thus, growth and learning about oneself happens through failure and iteration.

Since a fixed mindset is focused on static intelligence and growth mindset assumes intelligence can be developed, the underlying premise of innovation is to have an open, growth mindset. Historically, many government employees and agencies have relied on a fixed mindset. When anything "new" or “innovative” comes around it usually involves a shift in mindset to absorb the new way of thinking or an attitude. Essentially, it requires a growth mindset and that behaviors can be learned. 

In this section you’ll find a few mindsets that are required to be more innovative. Over time we’ll add different mindsets to this section to further the growth and learning mindset mentality and to help you learn about new and emerging schools of thought. Here are links to the mindsets in this section:

#Innovation Definition: Lean & Lean Startup Mindset

The use of "Lean Startup" processes is one particular methodology that can be adapted and applied to bring tangible impact a broad array of missions and agency-specific contexts. Pioneered by educator and serial entrepreneur Steve Blank, “Lean” is a conceptual framework for innovation, both as a matter of process improvement and of culture change. It’s a set of tools and a language for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of problem-solving that can be successfully applied to corporations and the government alike. 

The idea of a "blueprint for innovation" might sound paradoxical at first. But those most familiar with Lean Startup have called it the “**scientific method for evidence-based innovation**” because of its structured, testable principles. [Andrea Kates] It has an established track record in producing improved outcomes in both the private and public sector. And philosophically, the concepts are deeply aligned with the drive to infuse evidence-based decisionmaking into government and the tiered approach of piloting, testing, and scaling up promising solutions.  [LINK to EBP content here]] 

## Why Lean and Lean Startup?

A startup is not just a place filled with twenty-somethings in Silicon Valley, observes Eric Ries, the author of the seminal book "[The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/book)." Rather, a startup is any** **“*human institution* designed to *deliver a new product or service* under conditions of *extreme uncertainty***.**” The concept has little to do with the size of an organization and its sector or industry. [[Startup Lessons Learned](http://www.slideshare.net/startuplessonslearned/2009-09-08-the-lean-startup-gov-20-summit-edition/14-Product_Development_at_Lean_Startupbr)] The term “startup” is instead a shorthand descriptor for a way of way of working that uses hypothesis-driven, incremental steps with “build, measure, learn” feedback loops to continually create improvements.  [[crosslink OODA content below]]

Lean methodologies are smaller tactical pieces to the larger challenge of realizing the creation of spaces and structures that permit innovation in agencies and departments. An organization can cover all its prerequisites for effective change – proper team structure, strong personnel, clear mission strategy, and a culture conducive to change – yet these are only raw materials, analogous to kindling, wood, and flint. Where does the spark for transformative innovation come from? Lean can provide the structure for "converting the raw materials of innovation into real-world breakthrough success." (Eric Ries, p. 27) 

While the public sector is by no means a startup company, adopting effective Lean techniques can:

* Break the status quo and overcome obstacles with effective change management processes

* Build an entrepreneurial mindset and agency culture that’s responsive to stakeholders by design

* Generate new ideas for improvement and build capacity for translating ideas into action

## How Lean & Lean Startup are Applied

At their core, Lean methods are about applying a collaborative, team-based approach to accelerate finding solutions to problems. The mindset stresses the importance of challenging assumptions and reacting quickly to new information, using hypothesis development and testing as part of "customer discovery." With its emphasis on the end-user, it has considerable overlap with human centered-design principles. [[LINK to HCD content]] Lean seeks a problem, then builds and iterates a solution. These principles can be applied to a very broad range of use cases; it’s not just for launching a business. Lean can be brought to bear in a range from activities, including program creation and management, procurement, and grantmaking. [LINK to further elaboration in D3]

The approach offers a way for agencies and departments to deeply understand the problems and needs of their beneficiaries and stakeholders. Only by understanding all the stakeholders, deployment issues, costs, resources, and ultimate mission value, can agencies then rapidly iterate solutions while searching for "product-market fit" (a solution that’s best aligned to the needs of stakeholders). Dean Chang notes, “You have to figure out your customer segment and value proposition. That core principle translates everywhere. That works at HHS, that works at NSF, and I-Corps -- it translates everywhere, even if sometimes you need to change up the vocabulary a little bit.” 

# Benefits of Lean & Lean Startup

Any agency is capable of reaping the benefits of startup methods and culture in its own work. A startup culture is a valuable asset for Federal agencies to develop – not for the sake of following hyped trends, but because certain methods and ways of working  help all levels of the civil service to be better problem-solvers and to be more nimble and effective in pursuing their mission. In recent years some notable ‘startup’ agencies spun up, including[ 18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/),[ United States Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/), and the[ Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/). Their early results demonstrate the value of incorporating some of the best private sector thinking on innovation into their public sector missions -- and their takeaways are applicable to a much broader range of agencies.

## Benefits of Using this Mindset

Lean Startup thinking is a broadly and deeply useful framework for Federal work, regardless of an agency or department’s mission focus. "Despite the methodology’s name, in the long term some of its biggest payoffs may be gained by the *large* [entities] that embrace it," observed Steve Blank [[Harvard Business Review 2013](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything/ar/1)]. By prototyping approaches that are responsive to stakeholder needs and incorporating feedback from user experiences, agencies can “fail fast” when experimenting with new programs and scale-up only the strongest and most effective ideas. **[****[NTSC 2012 mem**o](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/openinnovatortoolkit_nstcmemo.pdf)**]** Entrepreneurial thinking is a directly relevant skillset for program managers; “Entrepreneurship is a kind of management,” notes Ries. 

Lean’s theory of change has also been validated in the marketplace, and investors (e.g., Venture Capital and Angel firms) are beginning to adopt this framework to evaluate the Investment Readiness Level of a business, akin to the way the Technology Readiness Level framework is used to evaluate the maturity of a developing technology.  [Interview with Marc Wynne]

# How to Implement Lean & Lean Startup

Because Lean Startup represents a framework for bring ordering to innovative problem-solving, the principles are applicable to a very broad range of use cases for agencies. It is a useful tool for the development of new programs, but its insights also have relevance for areas like procurement and grantmaking:

* **Procurement:** Lean Startup principles complement agile development methods, which are increasingly encouraged in the use of technology contracts and IT services. Agencies and officers who approach their work with a Lean mindset will find a natural fit with the best practices recommended in the[ TechFAR Handbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/techfar/) and [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/), both of which encourage agencies to build agile development methods into their contracting and digital services. [[Phase II: Crosslink Innovative Contracting content]]

* **Grantmaking: **Lean thinking also complements the recent push towards diffusing evidence-based grantmaking approaches. [LINK TO V2/EBP content] Simply put, one of the core tenets is the notion of feedback on what's working and not working. Traditionally, many grant programs lack fully developed feedback loops. Several grantmaking agencies have begun evaluating how to encourage grantees to adopt Lean principles and practices through their grant process; one example is the Office of Adolescent Health within HHS, where grantees in the[ Teen Pregnancy Prevention program](http://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/oah-initiatives/teen_pregnancy/about/) have been asked to run their own ‘accelerator models’ that incorporate Lean Startup principles. Tiered grantmaking programs are structurally aligned with the idea of incorporating stakeholder feedback and iteration loops to respond to information about what’s working.

# History of Lean Startup

Steve Blank had been a practitioner for more than 20 years as a successful, serial entrepreneur when he came to reflect that everything he’d ever been told about startups was wrong. Silicon Valley had told him that startups were mini-versions of large companies, and they should follow standard business plans with five year forecasts – but he knew from his own experience that this was wrong. "We didn’t have a language, let alone a methodology, that really focused on the start-search-and-execute process," he notes. In his time teaching, Blank also saw that business school students were missing a crucial element between the classroom theory and real-world practice. Specifically, he observed an unmet need for a framework and a language that prioritized customer interaction. It has since become an often-repeated truism that “No business plan survives first contact with customers.” (In other words, business strategies only succeed if they address what customers’ needs and wants.)  [Steve Blank interview]

"Lean" was invented to fill the gap between old theory and current practice. Lean “was evangelizing very simple concepts in a conceptual framework that did not exist,” Blank notes. The three components of Lean represents the fusion of contributions from several thought leaders:

1. Business Model Design, from[ Alexander Osterwalder](http://alexosterwalder.com/):  *What are all the hypotheses we have?*

2. Customer Development, from[ Steve Blank](https://steveblank.com/): *A formal methodology to validate the hypotheses*

3. Build-Measure-Learn, from[ Eric Ries](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/04/validated-learning-about-customers.html): *Incremental and iterative engineering processes to develop solutions*

While Lean originated in the business world, some key insights are equally applicable to the public sector: No amount of careful and thoughtful advance planning can substitute for actual engagement with and feedback from a program’s stakeholders. 

# How to Deploy Lean & Lean Startup

Key ingredients for deploying Lean methodologies include:

* [Reducing the organizational friction costs in experimentation ](#heading=h.u7e8umptzjms)

* [Capacity building for effective implementation](#heading=h.35c3mqc4djnm)

* Openness and adaptiveness to new ways of thinking 

* Strategic and creative thinking to integrate quick iteration with planning and budget cycles 

## Reducing friction costs and embracing failure

Perhaps the most essential ingredient for achieving Silicon Valley results with Lean is also the toughest: Inculcating a willingness to accept and learn from failure. This is a natural tension to navigate, since for many programs, failure is not an acceptable outcome. The challenge for program managers and leadership alike is committing to processes of validated learning.  This includes deliberately creating smaller-scale experiments before full deployment, when failure still means a learning opportunity to course-correct and not a fatal consequence. 

## Capacity building for effective implementation

Incorporating Lean requires building up capacity – or providing the tools, training, and also an authorizing space for experimentation. It’s not enough to have high-level buy-in for agile or Lean practices, for example, without providing contracting officers with extensive support and training on what agile or Lean contracting actually means in practice.

## Openness and adaptiveness to new ways of thinking 

## Strategic and creative thinking to integrate quick iteration with planning and budget cycles

# How to Apply Lean & Lean Startup Practices

Lean emphasizes rapid experimentation driven by customer insight. Its counterintuitive practices – like front-loading feedback into the discovery process – actually have the result of shortening planning cycles. As a formal method, the Lean Startup method consists of three parts:

1. The [Model Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc) – to frame hypotheses

2. [Customer Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984999302/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0984999302&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwsteveblank-20) – to test those hypotheses in front of customers

3. Iteratively build[ Minimum Viable Prototypes to maximize learning](https://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/) (Build, Measure, Learn)

For the public sector, the [Mission Model Canvas](https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/) (a variant of the [Business Model Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc)) provides a structured process for developing a deeper understanding of the problem at hand, the challenges of deploying a solution, and the potential responses that could be used effectively. Generating ideas through the mission model canvas is the first step in the four stage-customer development process:

1. State the hypothesis and draw the mission model canvas

2. Test the problem

3. Test the solution

4. Verify or pivot

## Four Steps to Lean

* Step 1: Break down your grand vision into component parts, and sketch out your hypothesis. 

* Step 2: Test the problem

* Step 3: Test the solution

* Step 4: Verify or pivot

* (Step 5: Iterate the loop as necessary)

Watch Steve Blank’s[ 2 minute video overview](https://videos.files.wordpress.com/6f5VMvrR/what-is-customer-discovery_dvd.mp4) of these four steps.

### Step 1: Break down your grand vision into component parts, and sketch out your hypothesis. 

Use the [Mission Model canvas](https://steveblank.com/2016/02/23/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations/). It’s an adaptation of the business model canvas for mission-driven agencies.  (Read more on the history of how the mission model canvas evolved from the well-known business model canvas, or[ listen](https://soundcloud.com/clearshore/the-mission-model-canvas-an-adapted-business-model-canvas-for-mission-driven-organizations) to a 10-minute podcast on how to understand each box.) 

### Step 2: Test the problem (Customer discovery)

Customer relationships can be understood as beneficiaries. How does your team get buy-in from all the beneficiaries? This includes not just recipients, but also colleagues in legal, policy, procurement, etc, whose support you may need in terms of funding, mandates, user requests, and so on. Long-term support and maintenance also has to be bought into by the sponsoring organizations. Using the customer discovery process helps to identify the most critical stakeholders to get buy-in from. ([Acumen’s 10 tips for customer discovery in the social impact sector](http://plusacumen.org/blog/10-tips-for-customer-discovery-in-the-social-impact-sector/) also has concrete tips applicable to Federal customer discovery work.)

### Step 3: Test the solution with a pilot (Agile development)

First, establish what constitutes a successful deployment for your program or operating context. Next, run an experiment, likely a small scale pilot (think "minimum viable product “).

### Step 4: Verify or pivot

Step back and evaluate feedback received on the pilot. Do you people agree that you’re solving a high value problem? Do you understand the mission model adequately to move into execution and implementation? Decide whether support exists for further iteration on the piloted approach or if course correction is necessary.

#Innovation Definition: Human-Centered Design Mindset

Human-centered Design (HCD) is about solving problems for (wait for it), humans. As [IDEO](http://www.designkit.org/human-centered-design) puts it:

*"**It’s a process that starts with the people you’re designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor made to suit their needs. Human-centered design is all about building a deep empathy with the people you’re designing for; generating tons of ideas; building a bunch of prototypes; sharing what you’ve made with the people you’re designing for; and eventually putting your innovative new solution out in the world."*

Human-centered design consists of three phases. In the Inspiration Phase, you’ll learn directly from the people you’re designing for as you immerse yourself in their lives and come to deeply understand their needs. In the Ideation Phase, you’ll make sense of what you learned, identify opportunities for design, and prototype possible solutions. And in the Implementation Phase, you’ll bring your solution to life, and eventually, to market. And you’ll know that your solution will be a success because you’ve kept the very people you’re looking to serve at the heart of the process.

## Key Terms

* **Design thinking: **A human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

* **Frameworks**: Visual representations of a system used to highlight key relationships and develop strategy.

* **Prototype**: Quickly created representations of a product, program, or service to test a hypothesis or assumption about the usability and/or functionality of a feature or set of features.

## Why Human-Centered Design?

People design things and experiences to influence and shape the world around them. In that sense we are all designers, but we are not necessarily Human-Centered Designers. HCD takes work, a specific skillset, and deeper level of knowledge and intuition to guide practice and produce trustworthy insights. 

In general, HCD sessions:

* Lead to creative problem-solving in complex situations (innovation)

* Establish design and problem-solving as a team sport

* Require diverse teams (designers, business, technical expertise, personality, style, etc.) that must trust each other to tap into the wisdom in the room

* Generate stakeholder buy-in/ownership/investment because solutions are co-created

* Help non-designers better understand the implications of design decisions

* Allow teams to vet design concepts early before expanding lots of resources

* Use rapid prototyping to show or demonstrate concepts for feedback

* Demand testing prototypes with stakeholders--making improvements--and repeating the cycle.

The best problem solving approaches recognize the power of working across disciplines, learning from people, and considering multiple relevant perspectives--all while embracing reality and the constraints that come with it. 

# How to Implement Human-Centered Design  

There are several schools of thought in human-centered design--the Stanford d.school approach, the IDEO Method, and the Google Design Studio Method.

## Stanford d.School Approach

* Model: [http://dschool.stanford.edu/use-our-methods/](http://dschool.stanford.edu/use-our-methods/) 

* 90-minute crash course: For a true crash course in design thinking, introduce your team to design thinking following the video, facilitator notes, and participant handouts available through the d.school:

    * [Crash course video](http://dschool.stanford.edu/crash-course-video)

    * [Facilitator Guide](https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/ed894/attachments/0132b/GG%20Facilitators%20Guide2012.pdf)

    * [Participant Handout](https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/ed894/attachments/6cfe1/TheGiftGivingProjectB%26W2012.pdf)

## The IDEO Method

The IDEO Model starts with building empathy during the discovery phase, then moves through a flow of divergent and convergent thinking and doing. 

There are many tools that you can use in each stage and you’ll find descriptions at the [IDEO.org](https://www.ideo.org/) [Field Guide to Human-Centered Design](http://www.designkit.org/). It’s available for free in pdf or in paperback on Amazon.

OpenIDEO and +Acumen also run free online courses that are open to the public:

* [DesignKit: The Course for Human-Centered Design](http://www.designkit.org/resources/5)

* [DesignKit: Prototyping](http://www.designkit.org/resources/8)

If you want to learn how to facilitate the IDEO Method, there’s a [Facilitator Guide](http://www.designkit.org/resources/7) and a course. 

## The Google Design Studio 

Design Studio is a highly interactive, fast-paced facilitated session following a methodology commonly used in architecture and industrial design, but with some important twists. It has been called the "Iron Chef," of ideation. It can be intense, focused, and chaotic at times, but those lucky enough to have participated understand the power and effectiveness of this tool. It is mostly effective when you’re working on product or technology innovation rather than process or program.

Teams use the Design Studio methodology to achieve several key goals:

1. Collaborate to understand the nature, opportunities, and constraints of some articulated problem space. If you imagine your current state, and then some positive future state, the problem space (sometimes called the design gap) is the distance between those.

2. Allow ideas from various perspectives and insights to percolate within the team.

3. Solidify ideas and, especially, unstated assumptions from tacit or verbal states into cognitive artifacts that can be shared, evaluated, and iterated upon.

4. Create a culture of shared ownership around future product vision.

5. Generate a lot of ideas very quickly—usually no faster than three hours, and sometimes as long as ten hours.

6. Allow open and honest critique of various concepts.

7. Force participants to defend their concepts and negotiate with other team members.

A Design Sprint has five basic components that allow the group to innovate on an existing product, come up with a new product, or solve a pressing business challenge. As always, the method relies on bringing together diverse teams to:

1. Practice divergent and convergent thinking

2. Build something

3. Test on real users

A Design Studio can be modified from 90 minutes to a full-day session, and finally can span an entire week for a full experience. Here’s a broad outline of a Design Sprint:

* Monday: Unpacking the problem

* Tuesday: Everybody sketches

* Wednesday: Participants sort through and decide what to build

* Thursday: Prototyping

* Friday: Testing prototypes with real customers

In his book *Sprint*, Jake Knapp provides a DIY guide to all five days of the Design Studio. There are also great resources available through [Google](http://www.gv.com/sprint). There are a few Design Studio sprint methods to follow: 

* [UIE Method](https://articles.uie.com/design_studio_methodology/): Uses a case study appraoch to solve a problem and aligns with the business. This method focuses on four principles: 1) illuminate; 2) sketch; 3) present/critique; and 4) iterate. 

* [Design Studio by Todd Zaki Warfel and WIll Evans](https://vimeo/com/37861987): An offshoot of the charette, an intensive, collaborative, stakeholder meeting for designing, mapping, and planning solutions. Follows the 1) create; 2) pitch; 3) critique method. 

# History of Human-Centered Design

Human-centered design was popularized in the 1990s by the Standford d.school and the design company IDEO. It was an evolution of participatory and cooperative design, which is built upon various disciplines like anthropology, sociology, and psychology. The [principles of human-centered design](http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf) are:

1. Focus on human values. Empathy for the people you are designing for and feedback from these users is fundamental to good design

2. Craft clarity. Produce a coherent vision out of messy problems. Frame it in a way to inspire others and to fuel ideation.

3. Embrace experimentation. Prototyping is not simply a way to validate your idea; it is an integral part of your innovation process. We build to think and learn.

4. Be mindful of process. Know where you are in the design process, what methods to use in that stage, and what your goals are.

5. Bias toward action. Design thinking is a misnomer; it is more about doing that thinking. Bias toward doing and making over thinking and meeting.

6. Radical collaboration. Bring together innovators with varied backgrounds and viewpoints. Enable breakthrough insights and solutions to emerge from the diversity.
