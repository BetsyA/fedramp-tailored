<h2><b>FedRAMP Accelerated Process Overview</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On March 28, 2016, the FedRAMP PMO announced the new FedRAMP Accelerated process, which includes significant modifications to how FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authorizations (P-ATOs) are conducted. The goal of the new process is to provide a significantly faster, more predictable timeline for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) seeking to have their packages assessed as FedRAMP Authorized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The FedRAMP PMO created this process, in part, based on feedback from federal agencies, CSPs, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs), and the JAB. The PMO took their insights and transformed them into a new process that will reduce the time it takes CSPs to earn a FedRAMP authorization without compromising the program’s rigorous security standards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The new FedRAMP Accelerated process has three primary phases:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase 1 &#8211; FedRAMP Readiness Assessment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase 2 &#8211; CSP Security Package Development</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Phase 3 &#8211; JAB Authorization Process </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Phase 1 &#8211; FedRAMP Readiness Assessment</b><b>  <img class="size-full wp-image-52081 alignleft" src="https://www.fedramp.gov/files/2016/04/1.gif" alt="1" width="54" height="50" /></b></h3>
<p><b>Key Benefit</b><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Getting to FedRAMP Ready faster</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The old FedRAMP assessment process started with CSPs submitting hundreds of pages of documentation in the form of System Security Plans (SSPs), Security Assessment Plans (SAPs), and Security Assessment Reports (SARs), amongst others.  By contrast, the FedRAMP Accelerated process starts with a Readiness Assessment of a CSP’s operational system.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is done through completing a Readiness Assessment Report. This shift in initial focus is based on the practical premise that it is more important and valuable to initially assess operational security capabilities versus starting with an evaluation of the quality and completion of security documentation. In a nutshell, FedRAMP will assess a system’s operational security capabilities first as opposed to having CSPs undergo a lengthy documentation process first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This Readiness Assessment testing will be executed by an accredited 3PAO, and the PMO will review all submitted reports within one week.  This assessment will give agencies, CSPs, and the FedRAMP PMO early feedback on whether or not a CSP’s service offering is likely to be successful in obtaining FedRAMP authorization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After completing the Readiness Assessment, the FedRAMP PMO will review the results.  If satisfactory, the CSP system will be designated “FedRAMP Ready” and the FedRAMP Marketplace will be updated on the website accordingly.  Achieving FedRAMP Ready status is mandatory for any CSP pursuing a Provisional Authorization to Operate (P-ATO) from the FedRAMP JAB, and is optional for a CSP pursuing an Agency Authorization to Operate (ATO). Once a CSP is FedRAMP Ready, the JAB will prioritize and select which CSPs will proceed to the next phase.  </span></p>
<h3><img class="size-full wp-image-52071 alignleft" src="https://www.fedramp.gov/files/2016/04/2.gif" alt="2" width="54" height="50" /><b>Phase 2 &#8211; CSP Security Package Development</b></h3>
<p><b>Key Benefit</b><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Allows for full risk reviews during ATO process</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this phase, CSPs who are deemed FedRAMP Ready will be prioritized for JAB P-ATOs. Once a vendor is prioritized for a JAB P-ATO, the CSP must develop a complete security package for review including the SSP, SAP, SAR, and Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M).  Unlike the current process, all the components of the complete package must be submitted together.  The FedRAMP PMO will not review the documents one-by-one &#8211; instead the full security package will be considered in its entirety.</span></p>
<h3><img class="size-full wp-image-52061 alignleft" src="https://www.fedramp.gov/files/2016/04/3.gif" alt="3" width="54" height="50" /><b>Phase 3 &#8211; JAB Authorization Review Process</b></h3>
<p><b>Key Benefit</b><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">P-ATOs in less than 6 months</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The final phase of FedRAMP Accelerated is the JAB Authorization Review Process.   In this phase, JAB Technical Representative (TR) teams at DoD, DHS, and GSA will conduct a thorough review of a CSP’s security package.  Previously, the FedRAMP PMO conducted one or more reviews of the security package before turning it over to the JAB for additional review. The PMO will no longer perform duplicative reviews and,instead, will focus on managing and facilitating the process from end-to-end.  After the conclusion of the review, the JAB TR team will make a recommendation to the JAB to grant a P-ATO to the CSP.</span></p>
<h3><b>This is the Beginning</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The most critical part of the FedRAMP Accelerated process is feedback from each of you! </span><span style="font-weight: 400">FedRAMP is a partnership between the federal government and industry — and we want the FedRAMP authorization process to clearly reflect this. We need the continued engagement of both government and industry. So stay involved. We promise to continue to respond and iterate to ensure we’re meeting your needs.</span></p>
